Over the last 6 years, since joining the Department, she has regularly participated in regional conferences and organisations, which suggests that she is up to date and familiar with the current issues and status of her field. ","As a practising playwright and dramaturg, she has the background and experience to help students bridge between theory and industry. Her teaching evaluations are high and students comment on her ability to integrate academic learning and artistic processes. ","She designs curriculum and assignment tasks that support students to think and take risks, and to develop a clear subject position in relation to text and performance. ","Her pedagogical approach is to create a safe yet challenging learning environment to build trust and engage students, and one key aspect of this is through candid storytelling that connects with their identities while exposing them to other points of view."],["Dr Nguyen takes feedback from students very seriously. For example, she discovered that many students found it difficult to understand the key concept of Entfremdung, which was apparent from multiple assessments that demonstrated misconceptions and received low grades. ","She inquired into the reasons for this difficulty and took steps to change her approach to teaching. This investigation resulted in positive comments from students in but improved student understanding, as evident from her systematic analysis of assignments in subsequent years based on quality criteria. She based this analysis on recent scholarship that demonstrates the importance of universal design for learning as a framework for inclusivity. ","Dr Nguyen's impact as an educator goes beyond classroom teaching. She regularly presents her approach to teaching in departmental seminars and has conducted a number of Graduate Professionalisation workshops for tutors in her department. As undergraduate coordinator for Theatre Studies, she leads curriculum planning and is regularly asked to review curriculum at other universities.
